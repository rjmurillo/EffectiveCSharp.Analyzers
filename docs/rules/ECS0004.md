# ECS0004: Replace string.Format with interpolated string

This rule is described in detail in [Effective C#: 50 Specific Ways to Improve your C#](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-c-50/9780134579290/).

## Cause

Using `string.Format` for formatting strings instead of using interpolated strings.

## Rule description

This rule identifies the usage of `string.Format` method and suggests replacing it with C# interpolated strings. Interpolated strings enhance code readability and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors associated with mismatched format arguments.

## How to fix violations

Replace the usage of `string.Format` with an interpolated string. Interpolated strings are more readable and less error-prone compared to `string.Format`.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress this warning if you have a specific reason to use `string.Format`, such as when dynamically constructing the format string at runtime or when maintaining compatibility with older code bases that rely on `string.Format`.

## Example of a violation

### Description

Using `string.Format` to format a string.

### Code

```csharp
class Program
{
    void Main()
    {
        var str = string.Format("Hello, {0}!", "world");
    }
}

## Example of how to fix

### Description

Replacing `string.Format` with an interpolated string.

### Code

```csharp
class Program
{
    void Main()
    {
        var world = "world";
        var str = $"Hello, {world}!";
    }
}
```
