# ECS0007: Express Callbacks with Delegates

> This rule is described in detail in [Effective C#: 50 Specific Ways to Improve your C#](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-c-50/9780134579290/).

The problem addressed by this rule is the use of methods that should involve callback mechanisms without employing delegates for this purpose. Specifically, methods are being invoked directly without the use of delegate types such as `Predicate<T>`, `Action<T>`, or `Func<T>`, which are designed to handle callbacks in a type-safe and consistent manner.

Why is it a Problem?

1. Readability and Maintainability: Direct method invocations for callbacks can make the code less readable and harder to maintain. It becomes difficult to track what the callback logic is and how it flows through the system.
2. Separation of Concerns: Without delegates, the separation between the logic that triggers the callback and the callback implementation itself is blurred, leading to tighter coupling between components.
3. Type Safety: Delegates provide type safety, ensuring that the callback methods match the expected signature. This prevents runtime errors and makes the code more robust.
4. Flexibility and Reusability: Using delegates allows for more flexible and reusable code. Delegates can represent single or multicast methods, providing a versatile mechanism for handling various callback scenarios.
5. Asynchronous Operations: Delegates are essential for handling asynchronous operations and deferred execution, which are common in modern C# applications. Without delegates, managing asynchronous callbacks becomes cumbersome and error-prone.

## Cause

The analyzer flags method invocations where delegate parameters are not utilized for callbacks, instead relying on other mechanisms. This can lead to less readable and maintainable code.

## Rule Description

Using delegates for callbacks provides a type-safe, clear, and consistent way to handle asynchronous or deferred execution. It allows for better separation of concerns and reduces tight coupling between components. Delegates can represent single or multicast methods, making them flexible for various callback scenarios.

## How to Fix Violations

To fix violations, refactor the code to use delegates for callbacks. This usually involves defining a delegate type (such as `Action<T>`, `Func<T>`, or `Predicate<T>`) and using it in method signatures and invocations.

## When to Suppress Warnings

Suppress warnings if using delegates is not feasible due to specific architectural or performance considerations. Ensure that alternative methods are well-documented and justified.

## Example of a Violation

### Description

The following example shows a violation where methods are called directly without using a delegate for callbacks.

### Code

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public void Test()
    {
        List<int> numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 200).ToList();
        var oddNumbers = numbers.Find(n => n % 2 == 1);
        var test = numbers.TrueForAll(n => n < 50);

        numbers.RemoveAll(n => n % 2 == 0);

        numbers.ForEach(item => Console.WriteLine(item));
    }
}

## Example of How to Fix

### Description

Refactor the code to use delegates for callbacks, such as `Predicate<int>` for `Find`, `TrueForAll`, and `RemoveAll`, and `Action<int>` for `ForEach`.

### Code

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public void Test()
    {
        List<int> numbers = Enumerable.Range(1, 200).ToList();
        var oddNumbers = numbers.Find(new Predicate<int>(n => n % 2 == 1));
        var test = numbers.TrueForAll(new Predicate<int>(n => n < 50));

        numbers.RemoveAll(new Predicate<int>(n => n % 2 == 0));

        numbers.ForEach(new Action<int>(item => Console.WriteLine(item)));
    }
}
```
