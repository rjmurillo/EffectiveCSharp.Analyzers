# ECS0002: Prefer readonly over const

## Cause
Using `const` fields for constants that do not need to be available at compile time.

## Rule description
C# has two types of constants: compile-time (`const`) and runtime (`readonly`). `const` values are replaced by their literal value during compilation and cannot be changed without recompiling all dependent assemblies. `readonly` fields, however, are evaluated at runtime, providing greater flexibility and ease of maintenance. This rule suggests preferring `readonly` fields over `const` fields unless the value must be available at compile time.

## How to fix violations
Replace `const` fields with `readonly` fields, ensuring that the field is static and initialized either at the declaration or in the constructor.

## When to suppress warnings
Suppress warnings if the value must be available at compile time for usage in attribute parameters, switch case labels, enum definitions, or other similar scenarios where compile-time constants are necessary.

## Example of a violation

### Description
Using `const` for a field where `readonly` would be more appropriate.

### Code
```csharp
class Program
{
    private const int MyConst = 10;
}
```

## Example of how to fix

### Description
Replace `const` with `readonly` and ensure the field is static.

### Code
```csharp
class Program
{
    private static readonly int MyConst = 10;
}

```
