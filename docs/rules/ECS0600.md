# ECS0600: Avoid stringly-typed APIs

This rule is described in detail in [Effective C#: 50 Specific Ways to Improve your C#](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/effective-c-50/9780134579290/)

## Cause

Using string literals to represent member names or parameter names in APIs.

## Rule description

This rule identifies instances where string literals are used to refer to member names or parameter names. Using string literals in such contexts is prone to errors, especially during refactoring, as the string literals do not update automatically. The `nameof` operator should be used instead to ensure type safety and to facilitate easier refactoring.

## How to fix violations

Replace the string literal with the `nameof` operator to reference the member or parameter name.

## When to suppress warnings

Suppress warnings only if you have a valid reason for using string literals that cannot be replaced with the `nameof` operator. For example, if the string literal represents a dynamic value that cannot be determined at compile time.

## Example of a violation

### Description

Using a string literal to reference a member name.

### Code

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public static void ExceptionMessage(object thisCantBeNull)
    {
        if (thisCantBeNull == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(
                "thisCantBeNull",
                "We told you this cant be null");
        }
    }
}
```

## Example of how to fix

### Description

Replacing the string literal with the `nameof` operator.

### Code

```csharp
public class MyClass
{
    public static void ExceptionMessage(object thisCantBeNull)
    {
        if (thisCantBeNull == null)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(
                nameof(thisCantBeNull),
                "We told you this cant be null");
        }
    }
}
```
